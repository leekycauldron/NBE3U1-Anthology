    <br>
    <div id="text">
        &emsp; The first step to learning how to live together is to first understand your goal: to create a mutually beneficial relationship. Living together successfully will never be a result of tolerance, but through mutual respect and benefit. The example related to Indigenous peoples and non-natives is a great example. The two parties, with different cultures and tradtions, must learn to share the land. In order to do this we must create a mutually beneficial relationship. <br>&emsp; The short play "Cottagers and Indians" is a perfect example of this, as a mutually beneficial relationship is shown in the book. Arthur, the native, explains how he uses a motor engine to carry out his manoomin tradition: a benefit of colonization. White people can also benefit from this relationship by buying the manoomin, wild rice, from Arthur. <br> &emsp; Another thing worth mentioning is that there is also a lot of misunderstanding regarding the Indigenous issue. There is so much misinformation in the world and everyone has their own  version of truth, but by coming together to try to live as one party, we can all win. <br> &emsp; One more example of mutually beneficial relationships is between men and women. The two sexes are different, but that does not make one superior to the other. Rather, they each have their own strengths and weaknesses that compliment each other and make them stronger as a team.
