        Prologue: <br>
        &emsp;There are many issues in the world that people like to just turn away from. While it's easy to look at a problem and just cover it up or provide a temporary solution, it does not make the problem go away and often makes it worse in the long run. The first step to solving a problem as a community is to make people aware of it. Throughout this unit, learning about comedy and satire, I have learned about effectively conveying a message in order to get people to understand what is being said and the importance of it. A long boring paragraph such as this one won't grab the attention of many; however, another medium, such as a comic, would be much more effective.

            &emsp; These three examples demonstrate how one can become good community members. Part of being in a community is problem solving as a team. In order to achieve this, effective communication and action is required. <br>&emsp; "The Lottery" displayed how the use of being aggressive will help to get the message across. As Tessie made her point and avoided being killed by the village, it forced the village to think about the tradition and really question its validity. This method is widely used in today's world, for example, the current ongoing CUPE strike. They are presenting the issue of their undepaid workers, but doing so in an upfront manner which has capture the attention of the main audience: the government. <br>&emsp; Howie Miller used humour which allowed him to effectively send his message to his audience. By engaging and entertaining the crowd, they were willing to listen what he actually had to say. <br>&emsp;The story "The Dog, The Cat and The Mouse" demonstrated the importance of not only delivering a message effectively, but also that action and initiative is a must. The most effective and entertaining motivation speech will not benefit the community if theres is no action behind it. In the better version of the story, the cats take the initiative to protect the treaty rather than delegating the task to another group.

        &emsp;The purpose of this comic was to show how to effectively solve a problem as a community. Communication, the first step, is often done wrong in many cases (as shown in the comic) and in order to effectively communicate the issue, aggressiveness, humour and initiative are required. The reason for half of the comic to be black & white and the other half to be in colour was to show an under developed society versus a more developed one. Television used to be in black and white; however, after years of development, colour television was a thing...
