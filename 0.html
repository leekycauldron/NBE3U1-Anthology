            &emsp;To learn how to be human, one must interact with other humans in a meaningful way. Different cultures and also acknowledging the privilege we have is part of what makes us human.

            &emsp; In the article "Telling Own Own Stories" by Jennifer Podemski, Jennifer speaks about her childhood, as she was growing up "[she did not] see any representation of First Nations people or stories. This made [her] feel invisible. Like [she did not] matter" (Podemski 34).This is an example of different cultures and privileges. Jennifer's nation is not fairly represented on television making her feel like she is not even human. She lacks the privilege of having people on television that look like and are similar to her, simply because of her background. This example is inhumane, although a common problem seen in today's media, where many children do not get to see role models on television they can relate to because their culture and stories are not shown. The problem of underrepresentation is being fixed; however, the execution is incorrect where the media may include black or LGBT people simply because they are different instead of treating them like normal humans. This has a negative effect where black or LGBT people are reduced to stereotypes rather than humans because of how they are portrayed in the media. To overcome this and "learn to be human", we must stop defining people by their race, sexual identity or anything they cannot change because by doing that, they are no longer viewed as human but as a stereotype.

            &emsp;Also, the Bead Activity is another example of how we learn to be human. It required us to reflect on and identify our privileges. A relevant question asked was "I can look at the mainstream media and find people of my race represented fairly and in a wide range of roles." Similar to the previous article "Telling Our Own Stories", this question raises the issue of how minorities are underrepresented in mainstream media. Those who are white males have no problem looking at the media and seeing themselves as the main characters. This is a privilege that is not shared by other people who are different. Even if they were present in mainstream media, their character is usually very one-dimensional having their personality or story centred around their diversity. I can relate to this as a Chinese Canadian who loves to consume different media; Chinese characters are not fairly represented in the media. They are either nerds or know kung fu. Now, non-Asians come up to Asians and assume they know them based on the stereotypes set by mainstream media. This cannot happen to white people, for example, if one just watched "Breaking Bad" and saw an old white person on the sidewalk, they are not going to assume they are depressed and going through a midlife crisis. Simply, casting people of because of their skill and not to fill some "diversity quota" is the solution. However, this cannot be done if those that hold the privilege of being fairly represented, do not recognize their privilege and decide to make the change. Without that, nothing will happen and minorities will continue to be seen as "not human".

            &emsp;The purpose of these examples is to show that being human is not just about oneself, but about how one interacts with their environment and peers. Being human is a group effort. A coloured girl who can see herself fairly represented in a TV show will not feel invisible or like she does not matter, she will feel like a human.
